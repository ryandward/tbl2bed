# Convert an NCBI feature table (ft) into a bed file (bed)

This processes one or more input files that contain information about genomic features in the GenBank format, and generates output in a tab-separated format.

The script begins by defining some variables and settings for the awk interpreter. The `FS` and `OFS` variables are set to tab characters, which define the input and output field separators. The `PROCINFO` array is used to specify that the input records should be sorted by their numeric fields in ascending order.

The script then defines a block of code that is executed at the beginning of the input (the `BEGIN` block). This block initializes the variables and sets up some default values.

Next, the script defines a number of `awk` pattern-action pairs that define how the script should process the input. If all of these conditions are met and a feature is relevant and valid, then the code block associated with this pattern will be executed. This block of code iterates over the values stored in the arrays `left`, `right`, and `strand`, and prints out a tab-separated line for each value in the arrays that are pertinent to the `bed` format.

Overall, this script processes input files in the GenBank format and generates output in a tab-separated format that contains information about the genomic features in the input files.
